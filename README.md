Hi I'm iv (or shade, it doesn't matter)
I don't care about what pronouns you use for me as long as I know you're referring to me
I just wanna start posting my projects so here's the repository

I'm an absolute beginner with anything relating to programming
I'm learning: Python
I want to learn: C (C++ and C#), JS, HTML, CSS

I really like ice cream, whales, and anything related to space
